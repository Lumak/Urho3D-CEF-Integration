To Build
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To build it, unzip/drop the repository into your Urho3D/ folder and build it using the cmake_vs2013-cef.bat
or create your own batch file. I have only tested for Windows so far.

Note that there is a required flag: **-DURHO3D_STATIC_RUNTIME=1**  
CEF will not run properly without this Static Runtime flag.

CEF distribution: **cef_binary_3.2785.1466.g80e473e_windows32**

google the distribution name and it'll take you to the cef automated build page on spotify.
If you're using a different distribution, do the following:  
  *  diff the two CMakeLists files in this distribution folder with yours and add the diff to your CMakeLists files.
  *  copy the cefsimple folder to your distribution folder.
  *  change set(CEF_DISTRIBUTION **cef_binary_3.2785.1466.g80e473e_windows32**) in 56_CefIntegration/CMakeLists.txt and rename it to your distribution name.

Known Crash Issue

There was an occasional crash when streaming video, but it's no longer the case. However, I appreciate any crash reports you can email me from whatever project that you're working on. Thanks.
